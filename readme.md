Skills:
This project provide opportunity to use my basic knowledge about terminal, HTML syntax, GIT and GITHUB workflow. I created and organized files in directories needed for simple web-site. Used VC Studio for work with HTML files. Used HTML syntax to create organized content of the web-pages with basic elements like <h1> for headers and <ul> for unordered lists. Also i created links between pages with <a> element.
